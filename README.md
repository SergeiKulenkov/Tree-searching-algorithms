# Tree-searching-algorithms

A compilation of tree searching algorithms:
* Depth first (iterative and recursive) and breadth first traversng to print a given tree
* TreeIncludes - using BFS checks if a target is present in a given tree
* TreeSum - using recursive DFS sums up all nodes' values in a given tree
* TreeMinValue (iterative and recursive) - using DFS finds the minimum value in a given tree
* TreeMaxPathSum - gets the maximum path length from values in a given tree
